== The Challenge 
SoyJoy is a healthy soy snack bar for everyone to enjoy without feeling the guilt. Its brand purpose is to make staying healthy feel fun and easy. 

Through this campaign, SoyJoy wants to introduce itself into the lives of working female professionals in Singapore.

== The Insight 
We looked deeper and realised that most women put their bodies through a lot of stress and abuse for at least 10 hours everyday.

== The Idea 
Therefore we've tasked ourselves to position SoyJoy as a symbol and reminder for women to take time out to treat themselves well. 

We created an integrated campaign for women to experience what short breaks could do for them. We call it 2Min of Soy Goodness.  	

It promotes taking short 2-minute breaks to enjoy a bar of SoyJoy and play an addictive mobile game or a brain-teasing Facebook game hosted by a quirky Japanese man called Oba. The games are pre-programmed with bonus rounds which come on during snack times and are activated with special codes on every SoyJoy pack to reveal special videos of Oba.
