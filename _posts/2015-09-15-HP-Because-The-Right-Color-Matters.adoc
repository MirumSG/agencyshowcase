:hp-image: https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14326240/10155367/c28f3ce6-66a6-11e5-8ce4-33e085e3cff6.jpg

== The Challenge 
Creative professionals face a pressing problem. The colour they see on screen is never the same on print. To fix this, HP offered business owners a free 30-day trial of the HP DreamColor Suite, an integrated solution that delivers colour accuracy from vision to production. The challenge was to convince and encourage them to sign up for it..

== Insight 
Creative industries thrive on perfection. Even the slightest error in colour reproduction can badly impact your business. And your life.

== The Idea 
Because The Right Colour Matters dramatises the disastrous consequences of color inaccuracy during the next 30 days. Far-fetched yet terrifyingly possible, these unfortunate events can change your business and life for the worse. The aim is to get our audience to think about what those 30 days could be like if they signed up for the HP DreamColor 30-day trial. 

Engaging stories were told in the form of multi-frame banners as well as an entertaining blog story about people meeting catastrophic endings all because they saw the wrong colour on screen.

== The Effect 
The entertainment paid off. Although launched in only three countries - Australia, New Zealand and India, there were close to 15,000 site visits. Close to 100 companies signed up for the trial. An impressive feat for a niche B2B campaign that involves a product of substantial investment.
