== Client Background
The Singapore Exhibition and Convention Bureau (SECB) is a group within Singapore Tourism Board – the country’s leading economic development agency in tourism. SECB aims to establish Singapore as a dynamic business events destination to a worldwide audience. It aims to position Singapore as an ecosystem of ideas, people, institutions and technology coming together to foster vibrant knowledge and useful networking. SECB values industry partnerships and collaborates with associations and industry stakeholders to identify key opportunities for expansion and growth.

== The Objective
To introduce and showcase new features and content on the newly revamped SECB’s website through an introductory video.

== The Challenge 
Ensuring the video effectively communicates the key highlights of the newly revamped website, yet keeping it succinct, lively and engaging for our target audience.

== The Concept
The video idea is developed in line with the overall STB BTMICE branding and newly designed website. It uses kinetic animation that mixes motion and text to amplify the key highlights of the site. Subtle sound effects, ambient music as well as an upbeat voice-over were added to enhance the whole video experience.
