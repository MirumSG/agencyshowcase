Project: Future of Retirement: Demonstrating Thought Leadership

== Client Background
Every year since 2005, HSBC has published The Future of Retirement, an independent study on global retirement trends. Yet as competitors like DBS and OCBC venture into this lucrative sphere, HSBC wanted to reaffirm its position in the Singapore market as a thought leader in retirement planning.
