== The Challenge
When Gardens by the Bay opened to great fanfare, they also wanted to engage potential visitors to its online site. The challenge was to create a similar digital presence that would get users to learn and share about the Gardens.

== The Idea 
Inspired by the close relationship between technology and nature, we designed a portal on Adobe AEM with integration to Google Analytics that reflected the same sense of life the Gardens portrayed. A Facebook page was also created to increase awareness of the Gardens.

== The Results
The portal launch quickly acquired 5,000 subscribers and drew in 750,000 site visits in six months. The Facebook page saw similar success, crossing 10,000 fans in a short span of time.
