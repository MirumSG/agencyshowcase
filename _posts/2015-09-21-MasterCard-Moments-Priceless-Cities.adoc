== Client Background
To instill preference and encourage card usage, MasterCard APMEA (Asia Pacific, Middle East, Asia) works with merchant partners and issuers to obtain promotions and incentives for MasterCard cardholders. These offers are featured on the respective MasterCard local market websites or campaign microsites.

== The Challenge 
With 18 internal stakeholders, including the global office, regional office and respective local offices, MasterCard needed to efficiently synchronise and capture the different stakeholder requirements across a central platform. The platform and supported sites also had to support all regional language and cultural requirements from countries such as China, Japan, Korea and the Middle East.

== The Idea
Mirum developed a central platform on Adobe CQ5.5. Integrated with various site management and email marketing tools, the platform was set up to improve cross-border and cross-departments efficiency in sharing content and campaign information.

Aside from the platform, we also launched 6 sites within 6 months (3 of which are in Simplified Chinese and Japanese). We developed and set up Workflow, ACL, as well as a custom solution for XML feed generation into and out of the platform, and we optimised the platform for website taxonomy, responsive web and dynamic content. We followed through with CQ5.5 consultancy and training to agencies and local clients.

== The Results
The intelligent and user-friendly platform now streamlines internal processes, helping to remove redundancies and speeds up new campaign site launches. Content is also standardised and localised by country and language, with the content editor allowing users to easily publish pages without IT support. 

In addition, robust website analytics allow clients and agencies to adapt to market and end-usersâ€™ needs.
