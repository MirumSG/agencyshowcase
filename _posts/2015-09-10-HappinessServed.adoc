== The Challenge 
Service levels in Singapore have not been up to standard in the eyes of Singaporeans and education about the benefits of what great service can do for businesses has not seemed to spark positive change on their end. 

We wanted to avoid the typical government-fronted campaign approach of information dissemination to businesses and instead, focus on encouraging active customer participation to recognise good service providers as role models – at the same time improving the perception of jobs in the service sector.

== The Insight 
Singaporeans are generally not expressive in nature and tend to focus on the negative, so our main challenge was to create a culture that recognises and promotes good service without any incentive, immediate reward or competition element.

== The Idea 
Spread across two weeks in Singapore’s oldest neighbourhood, the Happiness Served campaign required participating businesses to put their service in the spotlight through social media and get customers to recognise good service by way of hashtagging photos of their favourite service staff with #HappinessServed:) on Instagram – as well as physical voting slips. These photos and slips were used as votes to determine the best service provider.

== The Results 
We managed to generate passionate conversations about good service, improve the perception of service sector careers and recognise service professionals who provided good service.
