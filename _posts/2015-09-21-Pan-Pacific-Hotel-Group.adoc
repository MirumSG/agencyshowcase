== Client Background
Pan Pacific Hotel Group is a leading hospitability group that manages two brands – Pan Pacific and Park Royal, with hotels, resorts and service apartments under their portfolio. PPHG’s properties are based across Australia and Asia.

== The Idea
The Pan Pacific Hotel Group manages two brands – Pan Pacific and Park Royal. The idea was to design and build new corporate websites for each brand. Utilising Adobe AEM 5.5 as a content management solution, the sites were to be compatible for both desktop and mobile use.

Our delivery included a complete website revamp, including information and system architecture, user experience and creative design. It also relooked at application design, content development, analytics reporting as well as website and database maintenance.

== The Results
PPHG is now fronted by corporate websites befitting the group’s position as industry leaders. The upgrade and move to AEM also led to the implementation of clearer tracking metrics and improved updates.
